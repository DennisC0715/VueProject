# VueProject

The two states of the Upvote component are:

selected - The Upvote’s rectangular background (#E5E8FD) and the arrow body (#253CF2) is coloured blue 

not-selected - The Upvote’s rectangular background is grey (#F4F6F8) and the arrow body is black (#343A40)

Colour in the above wireframe only shows which group of Upvotes have the same connected state

You should not have different coloured Upvotes

Clicking on one of the black Upvotes will change the state of all the black Upvotes at the same time

Clicking on one of the blue Upvotes will change the state of all the blue Upvotes at the same time

Clicking on one of the red Upvotes will change the state of all the red Upvotes at the same time
